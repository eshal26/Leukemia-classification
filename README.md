## Introduction

Leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. Early and accurate classification of leukemia cells from microscopic images is crucial for effective treatment planning and patient management. This repository explores different deep learning models to automate the classification process, leveraging their ability to learn discriminative features from image data.

## Models Implemented

The following deep learning models have been implemented and evaluated for leukemia classification:

- **AlexNet**: A pioneering deep convolutional neural network architecture.
- **ResNet**: Known for its depth and use of residual connections, facilitating training of very deep networks.
- **GoogleNet (Inception)**: Notable for its inception modules that allow for efficient use of computational resources.
- **VGG**: Characterized by its uniform architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters.

## Dataset
This dataset is divided into two classes benign and malignant. The former comprises hematogones; the latter is the ALL group with three subtypes of malignant lymphoblasts: Early Pre-B, Pre-B, and Pro-B ALL.
